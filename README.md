## Welcome to the Down Comparison Calculator

Have you ever wondered how a jacket with 140g of 750 fill power down compares with a jacket of 190g of 550 fill power down for warmth?

This site allows you to enter the fill weight and fill power of any down filled item to calculate its total loft and therefore its actual warmth. Using this will allow you to compare down filled items with different fill powers and/or fill weights.
